I’m a first-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Priya Donti](https://priyadonti.com/). Before coming to MIT, I earned my M.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Chung-Ang University in South Korea, and my B.Eng. in Control Engineering and Automation from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in Vietnam. I also worked as a research scientist at KAIST, where I focused on safe reinforcement learning.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and control, with a particular focus on developing new methods for large-scale problems in power and energy systems. Currently, I’m particularly interested in embedding optimization layers and enforcing physical constraints in deep learning models, aiming to bring domain-grounded structure into the universal function approximators.
